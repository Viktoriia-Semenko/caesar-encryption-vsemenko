# Caesar Encryption Algorithm (Structured and Procedural Programming)

## Purpose of work
Gain experience in programming using a structured and procedural paradigm by implementing a
Caesar encryption/decryption algorithm. Learn the compilation and linking processes by
developing a dynamic library.

## Task
In this lab, you are going to create 2 projects: executable file and a dynamic-link library (DLL) for
encrypting and decrypting messages using the Caesar algorithm using the C/C++ programming
language. </br>
In this task you need to define the user command line interface of the executable file by yourself.

## Control questions
1. What is a low-level language?
2. Key characteristics of procedural, structured and imperative languages.
3. What is a dynamic library?
4. What is a static library?
5. What is a compiler?
6. What is a linker?
7. Why do we need `extern "C"` construct in the code?
8. What is a function pointer?
